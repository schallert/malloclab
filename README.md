# MallocLab #

For an assignment in a course at CMU (15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems) I wrote an implementation of `malloc` in C. My implementation used offset-based explicit lists for managing free blocks, with immediate coalescing and block splitting. My score on the assignment was 92%, the class average was a 76%.

Although I wish I could post the code here, the academic integry policy at CMU prevents me from doing so. However, if you are a potential employer or someone else with a valid reason to view my code for this assignment, please contact me personally and I'd be happy to provide it to you.
